# Mykee's Pizzeria

Welcome to Mykee's Pizzeria! This is my first website project, inspired by my experience working as a server at a fine dining pizza restaurant. This website includes three main webpages:

- **Home Page:** `home.html`
- **Menu Page:** `menu.html`
- **Contact Page:** `contact.html`

## Inspiration

This website was inspired by my experience working in a fine dining pizza restaurant. I wanted to create a site that reflects the quality and ambiance of such establishments.
